# Turn 1: Model A response

## Final Understanding and Solution

After analyzing the code thoroughly, I can see that the issue is clear:

1. The `from_string` method has the wrong argument order (already fixed)
2. The `__eq__` method returns `False` unconditionally

Now I need to implement the proper `__eq__` method based on the test expectations. Let me trace through what it should be doing:

Looking at the tests:
- `TestURIReferenceComparesToStrings` expects string comparison
- `TestURIReferenceComparesToTuples` expects tuple comparison
- `test_uri_comparison_raises_TypeError` expects TypeError for invalid types

The `__eq__` method should:
1. Check if `other` is a string - parse it and compare
2. Check if `other` is a tuple - compare directly using tuple comparison
3. Check if `other` is a URIReference - compare the instances
4. For other types - raise TypeError
